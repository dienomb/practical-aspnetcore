# Razor Class Library (3)

  We are exploring Razor Class Library (RCL) functionalities in this section. RCL allows you to create reusable UI libraries.

  * [Razor Class Library - Hello World](/projects/mvc/razor-class-library/razor-class-library-1)

    This is the simplest example to demonstrate the functionality of RCL. The library uses Razor Pages. Go to `src/WebApplication` folder and run `dotnet watch run` to run the sample.

  * [Razor Class Library - Include static files](/projects/mvc/razor-class-library/razor-class-library-with-static-files)

    This is similar to previous example except now you can including static files (javascript, images, css, etc) with your RCL. Go to `src/WebApplication` folder and run `dotnet watch run` to run the sample.
